## Overview

TypeIt is the most versatile JavaScript typewriter effect utility on the planet. With its simple yet flexible configuration, you're empowerd to type single or multiple strings that break lines, delete & replace each other, easily handle string containing HTML, loop, and a whole lot more.

For more advanced, controlled typing effects, TypeIt comes with companion functions that can be chained to control your typing down to a single character or millisecond, enabling you to type an dynamic narrative, with complete reign over speed changes, line breaks, deletions, and pauses.

## Key Features

-   Offers a beautiful, fluent API for chaining commands in order to fine-tune an effect.
-   Choose to start typing only when your target element becomes visible on the screen.
-   Loop your string(s) continuously.
-   Define strings programmatically or directly in the HTML (a useful fallback in case user doesn't have JavaScript enabled, as well as for SEO).
-   Handle HTML (even nested tags!) with ease, preserving all of its attributes (classes, ids, etc.).
-   Offered as an ES module for modern bundlers, or a UMD library for loading via a traditional `<script>` tags.
